| New OER Lyrics | Original "Creep" Lyrics |
|----------------|-------------------------|
| When you share here much more | When you were here before |
| Show the light in your eyes | Couldn't look you in the eye |
| You're just like an angel | You're just like an angel |
| Your spark makes us try | Your skin makes me cry |
| Now dance all together| You float like a feather |
| In a beautiful world | In a beautiful world |
| I wish for connection | I wish I was special |
| We're all so essential| You're so fuckin' special |
| But ideas can breathe | But I'm a creep |
| We're all heroes | I'm a weirdo |
| we are meant to be right here | What the hell am I doin' here? |
| We all belong here | I don't belong here |
| | |
| We don't care of its worth | I don't care if it hurts 
| We wann loose control | I wanna have control |
| In a world where all ideas are free | I want a perfect body |
| Weâ€™ll create, weâ€™ll ignite | I want a perfect soul |
| Open learning in the light | I want you to notice |
| Where every person finds what they need | When I'm not around |
| Oh, we belong here | So fuckin' special |
| No walls to hold us tight | I wish I was special |
| Oh, open culture | But I'm a creep |
| A beacon in the night | I'm a weirdo |
| Weâ€™re breaking down the door | What the hell am I doin' here? |
| I want a hopeful future | I don't belong here |
| I want an open goal | She's running out the door (run) |
| We will rise and make it clear | She's running out |
| Open access for every belief | She run, run, run, run |
| Itâ€™s the way that we strive | Run |
| Keeping dreams alive | Whatever makes you happy |
| Come together, build knowledge, be free | Whatever you want |
| Oh, we belong here | You're so fuckin' special |
| The futureâ€™s shining bright | I wish I was special |
| Oh, let us share now | But I'm a creep |
| A vision taking flight | I'm a weirdo |
| I wish for connection | What the hell am I doin' here? |
| Weâ€™re all so essential | I don't belong here |
| I wish for connection | I don't belong here |
| Weâ€™re all so essential | |
| Weâ€™re no longer strangers | |
| Weâ€™re building something whole | |
| A place without borders | |
| Where everyone feels whole | |

When you share, when you give,
Show the way that we can live,
With the tools that we all need to grow.
Itâ€™s all free, itâ€™s a start,
Letâ€™s embrace it from the heart,
Every resource that helps minds to flow.

Oh, we belong here.
The doors are open wide.
Oh, share the knowledge,
Letâ€™s break down the divide.

Weâ€™re in love, weâ€™re inspired,
Through the hope thatâ€™s re-acquired,
In a world where ideas can breathe.
Weâ€™ll create, we'll unite,
Education in the light,
Where every learner finds what they need.

Oh, we belong here.
No boundaries holding tight.
Oh, open culture,
A beacon in the night.

Weâ€™ll rise up, hand in hand,
Join the voices 'cross the land,
Open access for all who believe.
Itâ€™s the way that we strive,
Keep the hope alive,
Come together, build knowledge, be free.

Oh, we belong here,
The futureâ€™s shining bright.
Oh, let us share now,
A vision taking flight.

Weâ€™re no longer strangers,Weâ€™re building something strong,A place without borders,Where everyone belongs.


When you shared with me much more
Show the light in the eye,
With a strength just like angels.
Itâ€™s a spark that makes us try,
Letâ€™s embrace it, make it bright,
Every voice that helps our vision flow.

But ideas can breathe,
Iâ€™m a hero,
Weâ€™re all truly hopeful.

Oh, we belong here.
The doors are open wide.
Oh, share the knowledge,
Letâ€™s break down the divide.

Weâ€™re inspired, weâ€™re on fire,
With a spark that lifts us higher,
In a world where all ideas are free.
Weâ€™ll create, weâ€™ll ignite,
Open learning in the light,
Where every person finds what they need.

Oh, we belong here.
No walls to hold us tight.
Oh, open culture,
A beacon in the night.

Weâ€™re breaking down the door,
I want a hopeful future,
I want an open goal,
We will rise and make it clear,
Open access for every belief.
Itâ€™s the way that we strive,
Keeping dreams alive,
Come together, build knowledge, be free.

Oh, we belong here,
The futureâ€™s shining bright.
Oh, let us share now,
A vision taking flight.

I wish for connection,
Weâ€™re all so essential.

I wish for connection,
Weâ€™re all so essential.

Weâ€™re no longer strangers,
Weâ€™re building something whole,
A place without borders,
Where everyone feels whole.
